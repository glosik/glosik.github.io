##Five Front End Developer Interview Questions You Should Ask No Matter What

###How would you distinguish front end development from UX and UI development?

Generally speaking, the difference between UX and UI development and front end development is the difference between design and implementation. UX and UI development tends to focus on the human side of the design process, which includes asking questions about user interaction as well as testing and evaluating post-implementation. You’ll want a front end developer who is able to communicate this distinction while accounting for the occasional overlap.

###What do you like about our company’s website? What would you change?

Although this may be among the more popular UI developer interview questions, it works equally well for prospective front end developers by providing them with an opportunity to articulate their creative preferences and demonstrate their value. Fair warning: The ones who tell you they wouldn’t change a thing about your site are likely to be just as ineffectual as the ones who tell you they hate everything about it.

###Can you describe your workflow when you create a web page?

The workflow of front end developers has changed dramatically over the past couple of years. While every candidate’s answer will be different, the better ones will mention tools for simplifying and automating complex or repetitive tasks to save you time and money. Use this as an opportunity to learn about their organizational habits and tech preferences – or lack thereof.

###Which MVC do you use? What do you like or dislike about it?

MVCs, or model view controllers, are frequently used by front end developers as a way of organizing web applications and maintaining code. Some of the most well-known MVCs are Backbone.js and AngularJS. Candidates who can articulate why they use one MVC over another demonstrate that they are engaged in what they do, care about the technology they use, and have considered multiple options. Bonus: You’ll look like a total badass for knowing what an MVC is.

###What are your favorite features of HTML5 and CSS3? What would you change about them?

Obviously, answers to this question will vary. What you’re looking for here is a familiarity with the latest features offered by these core technologies. Just beware of candidates who say they wouldn’t change anything about them. Any front end developer worth your consideration will have a gripe or two about HTML5 and CSS3!
